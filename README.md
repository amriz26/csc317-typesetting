typesetting assignment 4 - csc317 

This project is a homework assignment based on materials from the MDN website, where I was tasked with styling an imaginary community college homepage using the provided raw HTML and CSS files. I focused on enhancing the typography by selecting two Google fonts: a serif font for the body text to give the page a formal, trustworthy feel, and a sans-serif font for the headings. I applied a base font size of 10px (~0.625 rem) and adjusted heading sizes relative to this, while also tweaking letter-spacing, word-spacing, and line-height for readability. I centered the main page heading and added text indentation to the first paragraph after each section heading for better structure. For the links, I customized the default, visited, hover, focus, and active states to match the page's color scheme, removed the underline on hover and focus, and added external link icons for clarity. I ensured the list items were consistent with the rest of the page in terms of spacing and line-height, and introduced custom bullet points to match the design. Lastly, I styled the vertical navigation menu to harmonize with the rest of the layout, adjusting the height of the menu items for better balance. This project allowed me to refine my CSS skills in typography, layout, and overall page design.
